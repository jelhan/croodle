              We can be sure that count is a number because it is destructed from a
              Map, which values are only numbers. But somehow Glint / TypeScript
              is not sure about it.

                Cannot use optionGroup.value because that's a ISO8601 day string
                (e.g. "2023-10-01"), which is parsed by browsers in UTC and not
                locale time zone. Therefore we need parse a JS Date representation
                of that string, which has been parsed by Luxon in correct timezone.

                  currently.
